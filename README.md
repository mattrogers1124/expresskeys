# expresskeys

A Bash script to set key bindings on the
Wacom ExpressKey remote, model ACK-411050.

Default settings that came with the script when I found it
are tagged as `default` in the commit history.
My custom settings for Krita are in the `main` branch.

## Requirements

Linux Wacom libraries:

## Acknowledgement

I found the original script somewhere on the web a few years ago.
I've long since lost the source.
If you know where it came from, drop me a line so I can give credit.

## Touch Ring Toggle

The script only has one function for the touch ring and Button 1.
On the hardware, the button is meant to switch between touch ring modes.
The original script had links to the Ubuntu forum posts
describing how to set up a toggle switch for touch ring modes.
I haven't tried it and can't vouch for whether it works.
