# expresskeys

A Bash script to set key bindings on the
Wacom ExpressKey remote, model ACK-411050.

Default settings that came with the script when I found it
are tagged as `default` in the commit history.
My custom settings for Krita are in the `main` branch.

## Requirements

Linux Wacom libraries:

## Acknowledgement

I found the original script somewhere on the web a few years ago.
I've long since lost the source.
If you know where it came from, drop me a line so I can give credit.
